# Challenge-5-Work-Day-Planner
This repo contains the documents for my UT bootcamp Challenge #5 Work Day Planner

## Description
The Challenge was to take the started code given by the bootcamp and make a dynamic work day planner from the hours of 9a-5p.

## Functionality
Once the page renders the user should be presented with the title of the page, the current dynamic date and time, and 9 hour blocks to enter and save events for the work day. The current hour block should be red, the past hour blocks should be grey and the future hour blocks should be green. Once the scheduled event has been saved by the user it should remain in local storage even after a page refresh.
